In this section, the process of identifying the sector in the quadrant based on the context of the problems will be demonstrated. The following numbered cases illustrate this process:

### Case 1

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I am an expert at making APIs. They asked me to make an API, and I feel too lazy to think about the requirements.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Reverse Prompt/CoT

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **High Knowledge** and **Unclear Requirements**.

---
### Case 2

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I have never made a microservice, but I have all the technical details I need to do it.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Full prompt

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **Low Knowledge** and **Clear Requirements**.

---
### Case 3

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I never learned how to create a data model, and I am not clear on what is needed.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Multi Prompt

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **Low Knowledge** and **Unclear Requirements**.

---
### Case 4

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I am a frontend expert, and they asked me to do something very easy. I don‚Äôt even need to ask for the requirements.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Zero/One shot

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **High Knowledge** and **Clear Requirements**.

---
### Case 5

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ Uhmmm, I am an expert developer, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing here, and I didn‚Äôt understand anything. But let‚Äôs go for it.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Freedom

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because the person is not sure about anything in a dynamic scenario.

---
### Caso 6

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I am learning to program in Python, and I need to develop a script following clear instructions.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Full prompt

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **Low Knowledge** and **Clear Requirements**.

---
### Case 7

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I am an expert in cybersecurity, but I have no details about what kind of tests they expect me to perform.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Reverse Prompt/CoT

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **High Knowledge** and **Unclear Requirements**.

---
### Case 8

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I have no experience in artificial intelligence, and the expectations are unclear.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Multi Prompt

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **Low Knowledge** and **Unclear Requirements**.

---
### Case 9

\- $${\color{lightgreen}Situation: }$$ I am an expert web developer, and I was asked to make a simple contact page.

\- $${\color{skyblue}Prompt \space Approach: }$$ Zero/One shot

\- $${\color{orange}Reason: }$$ Because in this scenario, we have **High Knowledge** and **Clear Requirements**.
